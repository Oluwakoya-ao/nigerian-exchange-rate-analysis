# 📘 Nigerian Exchange Rate Scraper & Dashboard

## 📌 Project Title  
**Nigerian Exchange Rate Analysis using Web Scraping and Power BI**

---

## 📖 Description

This project demonstrates how to fetch daily **foreign exchange rates** from the official **Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)** website using a **Python script**, save the data into a CSV file, and create interactive **visualizations** in **Power BI**.

It’s a practical application of web scraping using APIs, combined with business intelligence reporting.

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Python Web Scraping**  
   - Uses the `requests` library to extract exchange rate data from the CBN API.  
   - Converts the JSON data to a DataFrame using `pandas`.  
   - Saves the cleaned data to `Nigeria_Exchange_Rate.csv`.

2. **Power BI Visualization**  
   - Imports the CSV file into Power BI.  
   - Visualizes exchange rates for multiple currencies over time.  
   - Enables date-based comparison of rates such as USD, Euro, Pound Sterling, CFA, Yen, and more.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** (`requests`, `pandas`)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- **CBN Exchange Rate API**

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oluwakoya-ao/nigerian-exchange-rate-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Run the Python script** (from Jupyter Notebook or terminal):

   ```python
   # In a Jupyter cell or Python script
   fetch_and_save_data()
   ```

   This will save a file called `Nigeria_Exchange_Rate.csv`.

3. **Open Power BI Desktop**, import the CSV, and recreate the visuals.
